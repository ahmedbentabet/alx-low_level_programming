## 0x0E - C - Structures, typedef

- This project introduces the concept of structures and typedef in C programming. Structures are user-defined data types that allow you to combine different data types under a single name. They are used to represent a collection of related data items as a single entity. The "typedef" keyword, on the other hand, is used to create aliases for existing data types, simplifying the code and making it more readable.
