# Project 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This project is an exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It includes various programs that demonstrate how to use and manipulate these data types.

## Topics Covered

### Pointers

Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. This section of the project includes programs that demonstrate how to declare pointers, how to assign them the address of a variable, and how to use them to access and modify the value stored at that address.

### Arrays

Arrays are data structures that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. This section of the project includes programs that demonstrate how to declare arrays, how to initialize them, and how to access their elements.

### Differences Between Pointers and Arrays

While pointers and arrays in C can sometimes be used interchangeably, they are not the same thing. This section of the project explores the differences between them and includes programs that demonstrate these differences.

### Strings

In C, strings are actually arrays of characters. This section of the project includes programs that demonstrate how to declare and initialize strings, and how to manipulate them (for example, how to concatenate two strings, or how to find the length of a string).

### Scope of Variables

The scope of a variable refers to the context within which a variable is visible and can be accessed. This section of the project includes programs that demonstrate the difference between local and global variables, and how to use each type effectively.
