## 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project covers the fundamentals of C programming, focusing on variables, conditional statements (if, else), and loops (while). It provides an introduction to various concepts and techniques that are essential for writing C programs. The following topics are covered:

- Arithmetic operators: Learn about the different arithmetic operators in C and how to use them for mathematical calculations.
- Logical operators: Explore the logical operators (boolean operators) and understand their usage in combining conditions.
- Relational operators: Discover the relational operators used to compare values and conditions.
- TRUE and FALSE values: Understand the values considered as TRUE and FALSE in C.
- Boolean operators: Learn about boolean operators and their usage in constructing complex conditions.
- Conditional statements (if, if...else): Understand how to use if statements and if...else statements for decision-making in your code.
- Comments: Discover how to add comments to your code for better readability and documentation.
- Variable declaration: Learn how to declare variables of different types such as char, int, and unsigned int.
- Variable assignment: Understand how to assign values to variables.
- Printing variables: Explore how to print the values of variables using the printf function.
- While loop: Learn the usage of the while loop for repetitive execution based on a condition.
- Variables with the while loop: Understand how to use variables within a while loop to control the loop execution.
- Printing variables with printf: Discover how to print variables using the printf function.
- ASCII character set: Learn about the ASCII character set and its representation of characters in C.
- gcc flags -m32 and -m64: Understand the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 and their impact on the compilation process.
