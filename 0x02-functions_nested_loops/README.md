# 0x02. C - Functions, Nested Loops

This project covers the topic of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. It introduces the concept of using functions for code organization and reusability, as well as the usage of nested loops for performing repetitive tasks.

## Nested Loops
Nested loops are loops that are placed inside another loop. They allow you to perform repetitive tasks in a nested manner, executing one loop within the context of another loop. This section covers the usage and benefits of nested loops.

## Functions
Functions in C are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in code organization, modularity, and reusability. This section explains the concept of functions, how to declare and define them, and how to call them in your program.

## Declaration vs Definition
In C, a function declaration specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters without providing the actual function implementation. On the other hand, a function definition includes the implementation of the function. This section clarifies the difference between function declaration and definition.

## Prototypes
A function prototype is a declaration of a function that provides information about the function's name, return type, and parameters. Prototypes allow you to use a function before its actual definition. This section explains the importance and usage of function prototypes.

## Scope of Variables
The scope of a variable determines its visibility and accessibility within a program. This section discusses the scope of variables in C, including global and local variables, and how they can be accessed within functions and loops.

## GCC Flags
GCC flags are command-line options used when compiling C code with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This section provides an overview of commonly used GCC flags such as -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89, and their purposes in ensuring code quality and compliance.

## Header Files
Header files in C contain function prototypes, macro definitions, and other declarations required for program compilation. This section explains the purpose of header files and how to include them in your program using the `#include` directive.
